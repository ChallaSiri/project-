        <h2>In fact, email as a concept predates the internet by a wide margin.The first example of email can be found on computers at MIT in a program called “MAILBOX”, all the way back in 1965. Users of MIT computers could leave messages with this program on computers at the university for other users, who would see the messages the next time they logged on to the computer. The system was quite effective, but only if the people wishing to communicate with each other were regularly using the same computer.In 1969, the US Department of Defense implemented ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a network connecting numerous computers across the department for the purpose of communication within the organization On October 29th 1969, the first message was sent from computer to computer on ARPANET.</h2>
        <h2>t was 1971 when Ray Tomlinson invented and developed electronic mail, as we know it today, by creating ARPANET’s networked email system.The concept of nearly instantaneous communication between machines within an organization proved to be so beneficial and practical that the concept soon began to spread. However, with the advent of internal networks the protocols for sending messages became more complex. When sending a message from one computer to another within a network, how would one indicate where the message was intended to go?.</h2>

        <h2>The “@” symbol, which was probably his most enduring contribution to the internet. Indicating a destination for a message became as simple as addressing it: “username@name of computer”, which is essentially how email has been addressed ever since.By 1976, 75% of all ARPANET traffic was electronic mail. The medium had proved so useful that ideas were beginning to spring up about how one might be able to send an electronic mail message to a user on a computer outside of an internal network.<br>This concept of communicating via email from organization to organization was the impetus for the advent of the internet itself.
        As inter-organizational emailing became more prevalent, a need was created for software involving the storage and organization of such emails. With this, the precursors to the modern email inbox were quickly developed.By the 1980’s, the infancy of the internet, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) had begun connecting people across the world, and email “hosting” sites began to pop up, clamoring for their piece of the pie. For many new internet users, electronic mail was the first practical application of this exciting new medium.By 1993 the word “electronic mail” had been replaced by “email” in the public lexicon and internet use had become more widespread.</h2>

    <h2>In 1967, he joined the technology company of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (now BBN Technologies), where he helped develop the TENEX operating system including the ARPANET Network Control Program, implementations of Telnet, and implementations on the self-replicating programs Creeper and Reaper. He wrote a file transfer program called CPYNET to transfer files through the ARPANET.Tomlinson was asked to change a program called SNDMSG, which sent messages to other users of a time-sharing computer, to run on TENEX. He added code he took from CPYNET to SNDMSG so messages could be sent to users on other computers—the first email.
        The first email Tomlinson sent was a test. It was not preserved and Tomlinson describes it as insignificant, something like "QWERTYUIOP". This is commonly misquoted as "The first e-mail was QWERTYUIOP".Tomlinson later commented that these "test messages were entirely forgettable and I have, therefore, forgotten them."
        
        At first, his email messaging system was not considered important. Its development was not a directive of his employer, with Tomlinson merely pursuing it "because it seemed like a neat idea". When showing the system to a colleague, Tomlinson said "Don't tell anyone! This isn't what we're supposed to be working on".
        
        Tomlinson said he preferred "email" over "e-mail", joking in a 2010 interview that "I'm simply trying to conserve the world's supply of hyphens" and that "the term has been in use long enough to drop the hyphen".</h2>
    <h1 id="awards">Awards</h1>
    <h2>In 2000 he received the George R. Stibitz Computer Pioneer Award from the American Computer Museum (with the Computer Science Department of Montana State University).
        In 2001 he received a Webby Award from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences for lifetime achievement. Also in 2001 he was inducted into the Rensselaer Alumni Hall of Fame.
        In 2002 Discover magazine awarded him its Innovative Innovating Award of Innovation.
        In 2004, he received the IEEE Internet Award along with Dave Crocker.
        In 2009, he along with Martin Cooper was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for scientific and technical research.
        In 2011, he was listed 4th in the MIT150 list of the top 150 innovators and ideas from MIT.[10]
        In 2012, Tomlinson was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.</h2>
